# PiccoloF2802x-examples
Example code for the Texas instruments C2000 Piccolo TMS320 F28027F microcontroller

This repository contains example code for the C2000 Piccolo TMS320 F28027F microcontroller, to help new users to get started. The code is developed for the LAUNCHXL-F28027F Launch Pad Evaluation Kit, but should be easily ported to different hardware.

## Documentation
The documentation is auto-generated using Doxygen, and once generated should be available in the doc directory. We do not keep autogenerated files under revision control, and thus you have to issue the command `doxygen Doxyfile` in order to generate the documentation.

Please refer to the doxygen manual at: <https://www.doxygen.org> for information on how to properly write comments in the source files.
